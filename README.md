# VRFishing  

A physics-based VR fishing game developed in Unity, featuring immersive bait-throwing mechanics.  

## How to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Squ1ki-dev/VRFishing.git  
   cd VRFishing  
2. Open in Unity
Ensure you have Unity [2022.3.30f1] installed.
Open the project in Unity Hub.

3. Run the Game
Connect your VR headset.
Press Play in Unity or build for your target VR platform.

## Key Features
1. Realistic Bait Throwing – Physics-driven mechanics for an authentic fishing experience.
2. VR Interaction – Grab, cast, and reel in fish using intuitive VR controls.
3. Dynamic Water System – Interactive water effects reacting to the bait.
4. Fish AI – Fish movement and behavior based on bait type and player actions.
   
## Enhancements & Additional Features
Haptic Feedback – Feel resistance when reeling in a fish.
   
##  Known Issues & Areas for Improvement
1. Bait physics inconsistencies – Occasionally, throws may feel unnatural.
2. Fish AI tuning – Improving reaction time and movement patterns.
3. Optimization for standalone VR – Reducing performance overhead for mobile VR headsets.
4. Some parts of the code need to be improved and rewritten for better optimization.
